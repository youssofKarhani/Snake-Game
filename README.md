#Snake Game
<br />Welcome to my Snake game! This game is written in HTML and JavaScript and can be played in any modern web browser.

How to Play
<br />Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake. Your goal is to guide the snake to eat the food, which will make the snake grow longer. Be careful not to hit the walls or the snake's own tail, as this will end the game.

Scoring
<br />Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it will increase in length. The longer the snake gets, the faster it will move.

Customization
<br />The game's appearance can be customized by editing the CSS file. Feel free to play around with the colors and designs to make the game your own.

Enjoy!
<br />We hope you have fun playing my Snake game! If you have any issues or suggestions for improvements, feel free to contact me.
